      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <div class="subsec">Brief:</div>
      <p>An substitution of Hadoop implemented in javascript.</p>
      <div class="subsec">More specificly:</div>
      <p>
        A <b>asynchronous</b> distributed computing system implemented in javascript, which can be <b>used both directly
        in browser and deployed on server machines</b>.

      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p>Hadoop is not good enough.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Not easy and cheap enough to set up</li>
        <li>Cannot handle lots of concurent IO connection</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div id="slide4" class="step slide" data-x="2000" data-y="0">
      <h2>Idea</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><b>efficiency</b>javascript can run roughly as fast as C and Java on google's V8 engine.</li>
        <li><b class="red">Easy to set up</b>implement MapReduce in javascript, we can set up a node
          by just opening a browser and point to the server's IP address,
          the browser will download the script and start computing using local computing resource, CPU and memory.
          <ul>
            <li>it is super easy to set up a cluster for any use.</li>
            <li>Super easy to add/delete nodes.</li>
            <li>Super cheap.</li>
        </li>
        <li><b>server deploy</b>we can deploy both server node and client node on a traditional server,
          by running javascript program using nodejs, an overlay of V8 for javascript interpretation.
        </li><b class="red">unlimited IO connection</b>the model is asynchronous, it can support unlimited connections without block.
        On the contrary, since hadoop use java, it will create a new thread and block there for a new connection,
        which is resource consuming and unscalable.
        </li>
        <li>Security Consideration</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Usage Senario</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Big Company</li>
        <li>Small Company</li>
        <li>Individual: a immediate need</li>
        <li>Platform as a Service</li>

      <h2>Comparison: Setup</h2>
      Typically when a user want to set up distributed computing, he has two choice:
      <ul>
        <li>Buy from Third Party</li>
        <li>Set up his own</li>
      </ul>
      <p>No difference between hadoop and AsyncDC when he choose the first one.</p>
      <p>However:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>he need to pay for third party.</li>
        <li>not in any case he want to bother to find a third party: EXAMPLE:
          Sen Wang hardly need any computation ability in his daily life, but one day,
          he need to process image, which cost 2 hours on his machine. He want to do it in 10 minutes.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>If he choose to setup his own, the differences:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>using hadoop, he need to set up OS and Hadoop and dependencies for every machine.</li>
        <li>using AsyncDC, he just need to start AsyncDC in the main machine,
          and open browsers on as many machine as he want,
          No matter it's linux, windows, mac, android or ios.
        </li>
      </ul>
